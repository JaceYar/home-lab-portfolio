# home-lab-portfolio
Cybersecurity homelab using Proxmox, Wazuh, Kali Linux, Metasploitable, DVWA, and Wireshark. Built to learn network security, monitoring, and ethical hacking. Future additions: pfSense firewall and ZFS storage.


# 🏠 Cybersecurity Homelab Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity homelab! This lab is built using Proxmox to manage a virtualized environment running tools like Wazuh, Kali Linux, Metasploitable, DVWA, and Wireshark. It's designed for hands-on learning in network security, ethical hacking, and system monitoring.

---

## 🔧 Core Tools & Systems

- **Proxmox VE** – Hypervisor for managing virtual machines
- **Wazuh** – Open-source SIEM for log analysis, threat detection, and compliance monitoring
- **Kali Linux** – Offensive security distro for penetration testing
- **Metasploitable** – Deliberately vulnerable VM used for testing exploits
- **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App)** – Web application designed for security practice
- **Wireshark** – Network protocol analyzer for capturing and inspecting traffic

---

## 🧠 Goals of This Lab

- Learn to set up and maintain real-world cybersecurity infrastructure
- Practice offensive and defensive security techniques in a controlled environment
- Analyze and visualize network traffic and security events
- Build a foundation for certifications, internships, and a future career in cybersecurity

---

## 🗺️ Lab Overview (Coming Soon)

I'm currently working on visual diagrams to show:
- Network layout and segmentation
- VM topology and service interactions
- Future pfSense firewall and ZFS storage setup

---

## 📁 Project Documentation (To Be Added)

I will be documenting each project in its own Markdown file:
- Proxmox setup and VM deployment
- Wazuh agent installation and alert setup
- DVWA testing with Kali Linux
- Packet analysis examples using Wireshark
- Notes on system hardening and future improvements

---

## 📸 Screenshots & Visuals

This repo will also include:
- Screenshots of dashboards and tools
- Network diagrams
- Example logs and alerts

---

## 🚧 Upcoming Features

- Add pfSense firewall for network segmentation and VPN
- Set up ZFS storage for snapshots and backups
- Integrate Grafana and Prometheus for system monitoring
- Automate deployments with Ansible
- Explore vulnerability scanners like OpenVAS or Nessus
